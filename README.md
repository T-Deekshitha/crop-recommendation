#Crop Reccomendation System

This is a machine learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop based on soil and climatic conditions.

The system uses advanced preprocessing (SMOTE, feature selection), trains high-performance models like LightGBM, and offers a user-friendly Streamlit interface for both manual and batch predictions, with real-time output and CSV download capabilities.

Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy accessibility.
